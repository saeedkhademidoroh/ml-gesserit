> Gemini Prompt:

You are continuing a recursive deep research pipeline designed to map and expand a high-impact article list across AI domains. Your current seed includes the updated `t000_dr04_article-list`, a curated and deduplicated list built by tracing citations and trends across foundational and recent AI research.

Your task in this iteration:

1. Identify the most **influential**, **emerging**, or **referenced** works related to or cited by the papers in `t000_dr04_article-list`.
2. Expand the scope in three directions:

   * Follow citation trails (both backward and forward)
   * Cross-reference with SOTA benchmarks like Papers With Code, HELM, and MMLU
   * Add domain-adjacent works that introduce novel architectures, data paradigms, agent-based reasoning, evaluation frameworks, or societal implications

Each paper you include should have:

* Title
* Author(s)
* Year
* Brief contribution summary
* Citation source (mention which seed paper or topic it relates to)
* Link to the paper if available

Organize the output by domain and technique (e.g., CV + Transformers, NLP + Alignment, RL + Offline Training).

Avoid redundancy with `t000_dr04_article-list`. This new output will be `t000_dr05_article-list`.

> Gemini Seed:

Use the following files for seed reference:

1. `t000_dr04_article-list.txt` — The most recent curated and deduplicated list of milestone AI papers, covering foundational, modern, and emerging works.
2. `t000_dr04_article-source.pdf` — Fulltext source detailing methodology, structure, and rationale behind the current corpus. Use this to understand the filtering logic and thematic clustering behind `t000_dr04_article-list`.
