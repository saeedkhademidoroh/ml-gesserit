**Prompt for Gemini Pro**
Using the attached list of foundational and landmark articles (provided in the video description), conduct a deep research iteration that expands on these seeds. Your task is to discover additional relevant, high-impact research papers, review articles, or academic blog posts that either:

* Extend the ideas introduced in these sources
* Offer improved architectures, benchmarks, or theoretical insights
* Represent notable developments published after the last seed item (e.g., post-2023)
* Introduce emerging or underrepresented subfields that are thematically aligned

Each discovered article must include:

1. Full title
2. Author(s)
3. Year
4. Key contribution (1–3 sentences)
5. Direct link (if available)

Use the items listed in the provided article summary (video description) as your seed base. These include works like *"DeepFace"*, *"ArcFace"*, *"Transformers"*, *"GPT"*, and *"FaceXformer"*, among many others.

Return results grouped by domain:

* Face Recognition
* NLP
* Computer Vision
* Reinforcement Learning
* General ML Theory or Optimization

Ensure the list is diverse, includes recent research, and offers high discovery value.
