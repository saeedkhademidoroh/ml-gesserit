# ml-gesserit

A curated archive and chronological survey of machine learning literature — from foundational breakthroughs to state-of-the-art developments.

Inspired by the long-view strategies of the Bene Gesserit, this repository seeks to collect, organize, and eventually analyze decades of ML research in a principled and structured way.

## 🧭 Goals

- Archive influential ML papers from ~1989 to present
- Organize by topic, date, and citation impact
- Build a searchable index of trends and landmark ideas
- Produce structured notes and comparative insights
- Enable long-term research planning and model genealogy tracking

## 📁 Structure

- `papers/` – downloaded or linked PDFs (organized by topic/year)
- `notes/` – per-paper reviews, summaries, or comparisons
- `scripts/` – utilities for downloading, indexing, or formatting

## 🚧 Phase 1: Gathering

This phase focuses on sourcing and organizing papers. No analysis yet — just methodical collection, tagging, and curation.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Review & Synthesis

Once coverage is sufficient, we’ll begin comparative review across time, themes, and architectures.
